# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jae Kim

I'm a Junior Software Developer specializing in creating user-friendly and visually appealing applications. My expertise revolves around front-end web development specializing in ReactJS. I enjoy problem-solving and learning new things, which is why I enjoy coding and coming up with creative project ideas and producing them into working applications. I am continuously learning new skills to further enhance my developing skills. My skills include HTML, JavaScript, React, Express, and Node. I am always open to collaborating, so feel free to connect and we can chat!
